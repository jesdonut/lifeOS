# lifeOS Mobile — Spec

## Files
- `mobile.html` — separate entry point, all CSS inline in `<style>`
- `mobile-app.js` — separate logic, no shared code with `app.js`

## Routing
- Desktop (`index.html`) detects mobile via user-agent and auto-redirects to `mobile.html`

## Data
- Shares the **same save file format** as the desktop app (same `DATA` object structure)
- All DATA fields preserved as-is (NISA, bonds, currencies, etc.) — mobile reads and writes the same object, just doesn't display everything
- New field added: `spendLog` — line-item entries for food, commute, transport
  ```
  spendLog: {
    "YYYY-MM-DD": {
      food:      [{ id, amount, label }],
      commute:   [{ id, amount, label }],
      transport: [{ id, amount, label }]
    }
  }
  ```
- When mobile saves a line-item entry, it also updates `spend["YYYY-MM-DD"][category]` to the summed total — so the desktop finance view stays correct

## Persistence
- All saves go to **`localStorage`** silently (key: `lifeos-mobile-data`) — no download dialogs during use
- On next visit, splash shows **"continue last session"** to resume from localStorage
- **Export** button in bottom nav triggers a JSON download when ready to transfer (e.g. AirDrop to Mac)
- Loading a save file via the splash also writes immediately to localStorage
- `overscroll-behavior: none` on body prevents iOS pull-to-refresh; only `#m-content` scrolls

## Navigation
5 bottom tabs: **Day · Week · Year · Finance · Export**
