Codex checklist after checking `app.js` and `mobile-app.js`:

| # | Item | Codex status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 53 | Clean Defaults — Zero NISA Values + No Bank Account Presets on Start Fresh | Complete | Desktop and mobile now keep all save-file fields but use neutral defaults: `tsumitateMonthly:0`, empty `projectionYears`, and empty `bankAccounts`. Loading older saves still preserves existing NISA years and bank account data. |
| 54 | Currencies — Remove IDR, KRW, EUR from Display Cards | Complete | Desktop now renders only CNY, GBP, USD, and MYR cards. IDR remains in `CURRENCIES` with `hidden:true` so IDR rate lookups for lots/bonds keep working. KRW/EUR saved data is preserved in `DATA` but no longer has display cards. Mobile has no currency display card grid. |
| 55 | NISA — Compact Config + Scrollable Snapshot Table | Complete | Desktop NISA config now uses `nisa-config-row` with meta controls on the left and a scrollable `nisa-snaps-scroll` snapshot table on the right. The initial desktop `DATA` uses 3 suggested snapshot years, while `startFresh()` stays clean from #53. Mobile has no matching NISA config UI. |

Everything below this audit is the historical tracker/spec text (this is written by claude code).

## ~~1. Month View: Click Day → Navigate to Week~~ ✅ Complete

Clicking a day cell navigates to the *week* view containing that day, keeping the clicked day highlighted. Clicking the large date number in the week column header drills into day view.

---

## ~~2. Day Page: Two-Column Layout — Time Slots + Spend Side by Side~~ ✅ Complete

Day card body split into left (~60%) for events/tasks/time grid and right (~40%) for spend — always visible, no scrolling needed. Stacks to single column on narrow screens.

---

## ~~3. Day Page: Flexible Time Blocks (Multi-Hour & Half-Hour Entries)~~ ✅ Complete

30-minute visual time grid replacing plain hour inputs. Drag to create blocks with arbitrary start/end times. Blocks store `startHour`, `startMin`, `endHour`, `endMin`, `text`. Click a block to edit or delete.

---

## ~~4. Visual Restyling — Sakura Studio Palette~~ ✅ Complete

Full CSS token swap to pastel pink / warm blush palette. Lavender (`#e8e0f5` / `#9b7ec8`) for tasks, sky blue retained for time blocks, rounder radius tokens (`--radius: 8px`, `--radius-lg: 14px`), rose→lavender gradient on splash logo, active view button uses rose accent.

---

## ~~5. Logo Click → Jump to Today~~ ✅ Complete

Clicking the "lifeOS" logo in the topbar resets cursor to today and switches to day view. `today` now uses `new Date()` (real current date) instead of a hardcoded value.

---

## ~~6. Number Formatting — Always `toLocaleString()`~~ ✅ Complete

All ¥ amounts (spend inputs, NISA projections, currency cards, totals, expression breakdown hints) use `.toLocaleString()` for comma formatting (e.g. 100000 → 100,000).

---

## ~~7. Month View — Remove Expense Summary Section~~ ✅ Complete

Removed the spend bar chart and category breakdown panel from below the monthly calendar grid. The calendar now uses the full panel space. Per-day ¥ totals inside each cell are retained.

---

## ~~8. Color System — 8 Fixed Swatches~~ ✅ Complete

Replace all free color pickers with a palette of exactly 8 colors rendered as clickable circles:
`#2d5a3d` green · `#2c4a6e` navy · `#8b2c2c` brick · `#8b5e3c` brown · `#5a3c7a` purple · `#7a6830` olive · `#3c6b6b` teal · `#888888` grey

Apply everywhere a color is chosen: add event modal, category labels, countdowns.

---

## ~~9. Spend Categories — User-Configurable~~ ✅ Complete

Each of the 8 spend categories maps to one of the 8 swatches. A Settings modal lets the user rename any category and reassign its color. Default mapping (Food=green, Transport=navy, etc.) unchanged on fresh start.

---

## 10. Day View — No-Scroll Fixed-Height Grid (Google Calendar Style)

Day view fits entirely in the visible viewport with no vertical scroll. Fixed-height proportional time bands 4am–11pm. Multiple entries in the same slot render side by side as columns.

---

## ~~11. Sidebar — Replace 4 Tabs with Notes + Upcoming + Countdowns~~ ✅ Complete

**Notes** tab — unchanged.

**Upcoming** tab — unified feed sorted soonest first:
- Countdown timers (user-defined) shown as "in X days" or "today!"
- Events from `DATA.events` within 60 days shown as "in X days — [name]"
- Goals from `DATA.goals` for future months shown as "in X months — [goal]"

**Countdowns** tab — add/edit/delete named dates. Each entry: label, date, optional yearly repeat, color. Stored in `DATA.countdowns = [{id, label, date, yearly, color}]`.

---

## ~~12. 成長投資枠 — Per-Year Lump Sum Input~~ ✅ Complete

Replace the single yearly lump sum field with a per-year table. Each row has an editable lump sum field. Stored as `DATA.nisa.lumpSumByYear = {"2026": 500000, ...}`. `nisaCalc()` reads per-year amounts. Show `+ add year` / `×` to manage rows. Cap calculation accounts for variable amounts.

---

## ~~13. Currency — Manual Rate Editing + Base Currency Toggle~~ ✅ Complete

All currency cards show the exchange rate with an editable input. Toggle at top: "base currency: JPY | IDR" — when IDR is selected all totals show in IDR. Rates stored in `DATA.currencyRates = {USD: 149.5, ...}` (JPY base = 1).

---

## ~~14. Data Persistence — Auto-Save via File System Access API~~ ✅ Complete

Remove the 💾 save button. On first start/load, prompt once with `showSaveFilePicker` (suggestedName: `lifeOS-save.json`). Store the file handle; auto-save silently after every data change (debounced 1 s). Show a subtle fading "saved" indicator in the topbar. Fall back to manual download on browsers without the API. Show a Safari-specific warning to use Chrome for auto-save.

---

## ~~15. Countdowns — Since/Until Mode + Smart Elapsed Display~~ ✅ Complete

Add a `mode` field (`'until'` | `'since'`) to each countdown entry. Data model: `{id, label, date, yearly, color, mode}`. Old entries default to `'until'`.

**Modal UI**: Two-button toggle `until | since` above the date input.

**Display logic:**
- `until` → current behavior: "in X days" / "today!"
- `since`, no yearly repeat → smart elapsed: < 60 days → "X days since" · < 24 months → "X months since" · else → "X years Y mo since"
- `since` + yearly → age/anniversary mode: "X years · next in Y days" (e.g. birthday: "age 30 · turning 31 in 8 days")

**Upcoming tab:** `until` entries show as now; `since` + yearly shows next anniversary "in Y days"; `since` no repeat excluded (it's a tracker, not a future event).

---

## ~~16. Countdown Modal — Contextual Hints for Type Toggle and Yearly~~ ✅ Complete

When the `until / since` toggle is switched, show a one-line hint below it:
- `until` → "counts down to this date"
- `since` → "tracks time elapsed from this date"

The "repeat yearly" label also gets a contextual sub-note that updates with the toggle:
- `until` + yearly → "(recurring event)"
- `since` + yearly → "(birthday / anniversary mode)"

Both hints update live as the toggle changes via `cdSetMode()`.

---

## ~~17. Bug Fix — Currency Section: Toggle + Amount Input~~ ✅ Complete

Two bugs in the savings view currencies section:
- Amount input called `renderSidebar()` instead of `render()`, so typing an amount never updated the equivalent display
- Equivalent line hardcoded `¥` instead of `fmtSpend()`, so the JPY/IDR toggle had no visible effect in the savings panel

Also added a **total held** row below the currency grid that updates with the base currency toggle.

---

## ~~18. Bug Fix — NISA Lifetime Cap Description~~ ✅ Complete

The info text in the savings view says "つみたて max ¥12M + 成長 max ¥12M (shared ¥18M pool)" which is wrong. Correct rules:
- つみたて投資枠: ¥1.2M/year max
- 成長投資枠: ¥2.4M/year max
- Combined lifetime cap: ¥18M (shared pool)
- Max annual contribution: ¥3.6M/year if both are used

The calculation logic already enforces the correct caps (¥1.2M and ¥2.4M per year). Only the description text needs fixing. One-line change in `renderSavings()`.

---

## ~~19. Year View — Clearer Goal Row Labels and Icons~~ ✅ Complete

Current icons and labels in the year view monthly blocks:
- `→` + placeholder `goal...`
- `◎` + placeholder `milestone...`
- `·` + placeholder `note...`

These feel abstract. Replace with icons and wording that better reflect life planning:
- Row 0: `★` + placeholder `aim...` — the big thing you want to achieve this month/year
- Row 1: `▶` + placeholder `by this point...` — a specific milestone or checkpoint to hit
- Row 2: `—` + placeholder `note...` — free text, observations, reminders

Small change — a few string replacements inside `renderYear()`.

---

## ~~20. Currency Cards — Rate Label Respects Base Currency~~ ✅ Complete

Each currency card shows `1[CODE] = [rate] ¥`. The `¥` is hardcoded — when IDR is the base currency the label still says ¥ instead of Rp.

Fix: when `DATA.baseCurrency === 'IDR'`, convert the displayed rate from JPY to IDR and show `Rp` instead of `¥`. The stored rate stays in JPY terms internally; only the display label changes.

Small change — update the rate label span in `renderSavings()` currency card loop.

---

## 21. Day View — Condensed Time Grid (Reduce Scrolling)

The day view currently shows 4am–11pm (20 hours). On a 13" MacBook Pro screen the full grid requires significant scrolling.

Two-part fix:
1. Narrow the default time range to **7am–10pm** (15 hours instead of 20) — blocks outside this range are still preserved, just not shown unless they exist.
2. Reduce per-slot row height slightly in CSS so the visible range fits within a normal viewport.

Medium complexity — involves changing the `HOURS`/`HLABELS` constants or adding a render-time filter, plus CSS row height tuning.

---

## ~~22. Currency — Purchase Lots & P&L Tracking~~ ✅ Complete

Track what you paid when you bought each foreign currency so you can see your gain/loss at current rates.

**Data model** — new array `DATA.currencyLots`:
```
{ id, code, amount, rateIDR, date }
```
- `code` — "USD", "CNY", etc.
- `amount` — how many units of foreign currency you bought
- `rateIDR` — IDR per unit at time of purchase (e.g. 17000 for 1 USD = Rp 17,000)
- `date` — purchase date "YYYY-MM-DD"

**Display** — inside each currency card, below the amount input:
- Collapsible "lots" section listing each purchase row: date · amount · bought at Rp X · now Rp Y · P&L Rp ±Z
- "+ add lot" button opens a small modal (date, amount, rate paid)
- Summary line per currency: total cost basis vs current value, overall % gain/loss
- Current IDR rate derived from stored JPY rates: `getRate(code) / getRate('IDR')`

**Scope** — medium. New modal, new lot rows per card, P&L math. No graph yet (historical snapshots would need separate infrastructure).

---

## ~~23. Government Bonds Tracker (Active + Matured)~~ ✅ Complete

Track Indonesian government retail bonds of any type (ORI, SR, ST, SBR) — monthly coupon income, maturity countdowns, and a full archive of past bonds.

**Example fields (generic):**
| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Series | ST00X |
| Face value | Rp 00,000,000 |
| Coupon rate | 7.00% |
| Tax (Pajak) | 10% |
| First coupon | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Maturity | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Duration | X months |
| Net monthly coupon | derived |
| Total coupons earned | derived |

**Data model** — new array `DATA.bonds`:
```
{ id, series, faceValue, couponRate, taxRate, settlementDate, firstCouponDate, maturityDate, matured }
```
- `series` — "ST005", "ORI024", "SR020", etc.
- `faceValue` — IDR principal (e.g. 100000000)
- `couponRate` — annual gross rate as decimal (e.g. 0.074 for 7.40%)
- `taxRate` — withholding tax as decimal (e.g. 0.10 for 10%) — varies per bond
- `settlementDate` — actual purchase/settlement date "YYYY-MM-DD"
- `firstCouponDate` — date of first coupon payment (usually 1 month after settlement)
- `maturityDate` — when principal is returned "YYYY-MM-DD"
- `matured` — boolean

**Derived calculations (all from stored fields):**
- Gross monthly coupon = `faceValue × couponRate / 12`
- Net monthly coupon = gross × `(1 − taxRate)`
- Annual net = net monthly × 12
- Duration months = months from firstCouponDate to maturityDate (inclusive)
- Total net coupons = net monthly × duration months
- Coupons received so far = net monthly × months elapsed since firstCouponDate
- Remaining = total − received

**Display** — new "government bonds" section in the Savings view below Currencies:
- Active bonds: card per bond — series, face value, coupon %, net monthly income, countdown to maturity, coupons received vs total
- Summary line: total net monthly income across all active bonds
- Matured archive: collapsed section showing each matured bond and total earned
- "+ add bond" modal: series, face value, coupon %, tax %, settlement date, first coupon date, maturity date
- Maturity dates feed the **upcoming** sidebar tab as reminders

**Scope** — medium-high. New section + modal, month-diff math, archive toggle, upcoming integration.

---

## 24. Bug Fix — Currency Lots: rateIDR Is Total Cost, Not Per-Unit Rate

`rateIDR` stored per lot represents the **total IDR spent** for that purchase, not the price per unit. Current calculations treat it as per-unit and multiply by `amount`, causing massively inflated cost basis and P&L figures.

**Fixes required (all in the currencyLots render block ~line 753–771):**

1. `totalCost` — remove the `l.amount *` multiplier:
   ```js
   // was: s + l.amount * l.rateIDR
   s + l.rateIDR
   ```
2. Per-lot P&L — derive cost-per-unit first:
   ```js
   // was: l.amount * currentIDR - l.amount * l.rateIDR
   var costPerUnit = l.rateIDR / l.amount;
   var pl = Math.round((currentIDR - costPerUnit) * l.amount);
   ```
3. Display rate — show derived per-unit price, not raw total:
   ```js
   // was: Math.round(l.rateIDR).toLocaleString()
   Math.round(l.rateIDR / l.amount).toLocaleString()
   ```
4. Modal label (line 1225) — change `"rate paid (IDR per 1 CODE)"` → `"total IDR spent"` to match actual semantic.

No data migration needed — existing saved lots already store totals.

---

## 25. NISA つみたて — Per-Year Monthly Amount

The tsumitate monthly contribution (`DATA.nisa.tsumitateMonthly`) is a single value for all years. As the amount may change year to year (e.g. ¥60,000/mo in 2026, ¥80,000/mo from 2027 onward), it should be configurable per year.

**Data model change:**
```js
// Replace single field:
nisa.tsumitateMonthly: 60000

// With per-year map (same pattern as lumpSumByYear):
nisa.tsumitateByYear: { "2026": 60000, "2027": 80000 }
```
- Default: if a year has no entry, fall back to the previous year's value (or a hardcoded default of ¥60,000)
- Migration: on load, if `tsumitateMonthly` exists but `tsumitateByYear` doesn't, seed `tsumitateByYear` with `{ [startYear]: tsumitateMonthly }`

**UI** — same pattern as 成長投資枠 per-year lump sum (#12): a small table in the NISA section with one row per configured year (editable monthly amount) + `+ add year` / `×` controls.

**Calc change** — `nisaCalc()` reads `tsumitateByYear[year] * 12` for the annual tsumitate contribution in each projection year instead of the single monthly value.

**Also added** — `startMonth` field (1–12, default Jan). The start year's contribution is calculated as `monthly × (13 − startMonth)` so a May start correctly contributes 8 months instead of 12. Start month is a dropdown in the NISA UI next to start year.

**Scope** — small-medium. Mirrors existing lumpSumByYear pattern closely.

---

## 26. Bank Account Totals Tracker

Track cash balances across bank accounts. Initial accounts: **BCA** (IDR) and **MUFG** (JPY). Display as part of the Savings view, showing each balance converted to the active base currency.

**Data model** — new array `DATA.bankAccounts`:
```js
{ id, name, currency, balance }
// e.g. { id, name: "BCA", currency: "IDR", balance: 5000000 }
//      { id, name: "MUFG", currency: "JPY", balance: 0 }
```

**Display** — new "bank accounts" section in the Savings view (above or below currencies):
- One row per account: name · balance (native currency) · balance (base currency equivalent)
- Editable balance field inline
- Total row: all balances summed in base currency
- `+ add account` for future accounts (optional for now)

**Scope** — small. Simple editable list with currency conversion using existing `getRate()` / `fmtSpend()` helpers.

---

## 27. Daily Finance Tracker — Income, Bills, Spending

Import and visualize the monthly financial data currently tracked in Excel. This is a significant feature that may warrant splitting `app.js` into multiple files (e.g. `app-core.js`, `app-finance.js`).

**Data model** — new `DATA.finance` keyed by `"YYYY-MM"`:
```js
DATA.finance["2025-01"] = {
  // Income
  salary: 0,          // 給料
  transportReimb: 0,  // Transport reimbursement
  taxWithheld: 0,     // 税金 (as negative or tracked separately)
  insuranceDed: 0,    // 保険料 deducted at source
  otherIncome: 0,     // 所得
  momPays: 0,         // Mom Pays (flights, hotel, etc.)

  // Bills (fixed monthly)
  rent: 0,            // 家賃
  gas: 0,             // ガス費
  water: 0,           // 水道費
  electricity: 0,     // 電気料金
  phone: 0,           // 携帯
  internet: 0,        // インターネット

  // Necessities
  paperwork: 0,       // 書類仕事
  medical: 0,         // メディカル
  necessities: 0,     // 日常生活
  nhi: 0,             // 国民保険 (NHI)

  // Optional spending
  food: 0,            // 食べ物
  transport: 0,       // 電車代金 (non-commute)
  project: 0,         // ゲーム / Project
  fun: 0,             // エンターテイメント
  clothes: 0,         // 服・髪

  // Transport pass (separate from daily transport)
  commutationPass: 0, // 通勤定期券
}
```

**Derived totals per month:**
- Total Income = salary + transportReimb + otherIncome + momPays − taxWithheld − insuranceDed
- Clean Salary = salary − taxWithheld − insuranceDed
- Total Bills = rent + gas + water + electricity + phone + internet
- Total Necessities = paperwork + medical + necessities + nhi
- Total Optional = food + transport + project + fun + clothes
- Balance Remaining = Total Income − commutationPass − Total Bills − Total Necessities − Total Optional

**Display** — new "Finance" view (tab in the main nav, or sub-section of an existing view):
- Month selector
- Collapsible sections per group (Income, Bills, Necessities, Optional)
- Each field: label (Japanese + English) · editable input · currency symbol
- Summary table at bottom: group totals + Balance Remaining
- Trend view (future): sparklines or table of monthly balances over time

**File split recommendation** — when this is implemented, split `app.js` into:
- `app-core.js` — DATA model, save/load, render dispatch, navigation, utilities
- `app-calendar.js` — day/week/month/year view rendering and event logic
- `app-finance.js` — savings (NISA, currency, bonds, banks) + new finance tracker

**Scope** — large. New view, large data model, grouped inputs, derived totals. No graphs in first pass.

**Note** — this feature is now shaped by #28 (weekly replaces daily). Finance tracking per month should align with weekly aggregation from #28 rather than per-day inputs.

---

## 28. Remove Day View — Weekly Becomes Primary Calendar + Finance View

The day view is retired. Week becomes the finest granularity of the calendar. The week view gains finance tracking (budget, spending, income) in place of the current day-level spend panel.

**Nav change:** `day | week | month | year | years | savings` → `week | month | year | savings`

**What happens to existing day view data:**
- Time blocks (`DATA.slots`) keyed by date — still stored, rendered inline on the week view per day column (compact, no drag-to-create; click to view/delete)
- Per-day spend (`DATA.spend`) — stays keyed by date, aggregated to weekly totals on the week view
- Day view functions (`renderDay`, `jumpDay`, the `setView('day')` path) — removed

**Week view additions:**
- Weekly budget target field (editable, stored in `DATA.weeklyBudget` or per-week key)
- Weekly income total (sum from the Finance tracker, #27/#29, or manual entry)
- Weekly spend total (sum of per-day spend entries for that week)
- Weekly balance = income − spend
- Spend breakdown by category for the week (same 8-category system)
- Each day column retains: event list, task list, compact time block display, spend entries

**Scope** — medium-large. Removes one view entirely, restructures week render, adds weekly finance summary panel. Coordinates with #27 for monthly rollup.

---

## 29. Merge Year + Years Views → Single "Year" View with Calendar

Currently: `year` shows monthly goal/milestone/note rows for one year; `years` (multiyear) shows a 5-year grid. These serve overlapping purposes and split navigation unnecessarily.

**New unified "year" view** (replaces both `year` and `multiyear`, nav button stays `year`):

Three sections stacked vertically within the same panel:

1. **Annual calendar grid** — 12 month thumbnails in a 4×3 or 6×2 grid. Each cell shows the month name and clickable days (or just the month name as a button to `jumpMonth()`). Gives a full-year at-a-glance calendar feel.

2. **Monthly goal rows** — existing year view content: each of the 12 months with ★ aim / ▶ by this point / — note rows. Kept exactly as-is.

3. **Multi-year strip** — a condensed version of the current multiyear 5-year grid below, for broader context. Navigation arrows change which year is focused.

**Nav change:** `years` button removed from nav. `year` button handles both.

**Data** — `DATA.goals` (keyed `YYYY-M`) and `DATA.multiYearGoals` (if any) remain unchanged. No migration needed.

**Scope** — medium. Remove one view, restructure `renderYear()` to include the calendar grid and optional multi-year strip. Most logic already exists.

---

## 30. Bug Fix — Years View: Day Badges + Equal Column Widths

Two issues in the multiyear (`years`) view:

1. **Events showed text only** — date information was lost when building the items list. Fixed by preserving `{day, text}` objects through the pipeline; events and tasks render a small square badge (e.g. `20`) before the text using the day extracted from the `YYYY-MM-DD` key. Goals (no specific day) get no badge.

2. **Month columns were unequal width** — CSS grid `repeat(12, 1fr)` cells expand to fit content by default (`min-width: auto`). Long event names pushed some columns wider. Fixed by adding `min-width: 0` to `.my-month-cell` and `.my-month-content`, and switching `.my-month-item` to `display:flex` so text truncates via `text-overflow:ellipsis` within its constrained column.

---

## ~~31. NISA Tracker UI Redesign~~ ✅ Complete

Redesigned the NISA section in the savings view to be cleaner and more information-dense.

**Implemented:**
- Hero strip: 4 stats — lifetime plan total + stacked progress bar (つみたて pink / 成長 navy), cap year, this year total, avg/year
- Two-panel side-by-side budget editor: つみたて (pink) | 成長 (navy)
- 成長 panel collapses empty ¥0 years with expand/collapse toggle
- Compact meta strip: start year, start month, this year monthly
- Snapshot table with rows + mini progress bars (uses existing `projectionYears` list)
- No new color tokens — `var(--accent)` for pink, `#2c4a6e` for navy

---

## ~~32. Year View Redesign — Timeline, Decade Strip, Category Colors~~ ✅ Complete

Refactor the year view to match the Claude-designed mockup. Keep existing data model, routing, and JP labels. Only change layout and styling.

**Required changes (in order):**

1. **Decade nav strip** — 11 mini-cards above the year list: year + age + 5-segment activity sparkline (dots per category). Click to jump to that year. Current year highlighted.
2. **Year card 3-column header** — left: year number + age chip + category counts (work · life · learn · travel); center: one-line editable summary; right: NISA inline meter (cumulative bar toward ¥18M, cumulative value, % of cap, delta this year).
3. **Continuous timeline** — 12-column CSS grid with month labels above; events positioned with `grid-column: <start> / span <n>`. Multiple parallel tracks so events don't overlap. Faint per-month gridlines behind tracks via `::before`.
4. **Event category colors** — work (pink `#c8456c`), life (blue `#5a8fc8`), learn (orange `#c87a3a`), travel (green `#4a8a5a`). Each event = colored chip with leading dot + label, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, `title` attr for full text on hover.
5. **Aims / Checkpoint / Note footer** — 3-column strip per year card, separated from timeline by a dashed border. Inline-editable (click to type).
6. **Collapsed empty years** — year with 0–1 events renders as a single-line card: `year | age chip | one-line meta (N events · NISA ¥X · goal text) | expand →`. Click to expand.
7. **Planner grid only for focused year** — the existing 12-month mini-calendar grid only shows for the focused/expanded year, and only renders months that have at least one event.
8. **New color tokens** — `--tsumitate: #e85a8a`, `--growth: #5a8fc8`, `--c-work: #c8456c`, `--c-life: #5a8fc8`, `--c-learn: #c87a3a`, `--c-travel: #4a8a5a`. `--accent` updates to `#c8456c` (matches mockup's rose).

**Data shape notes:**
- Events already stored as `DATA.events["YYYY-MM-DD"]: [{text, color}]` — use existing color to infer category (map hex → category key).
- Goals already stored as `DATA.goals["YYYY-MM-N"]` — use for aims/checkpoint/note (Q1→aim, Q2→checkpoint, Q3→note, or keep existing structure).
- No new data fields required; category assignment is a display-layer concern based on event color.

**Scope** — large. Touches `renderYear`, `renderMultiYear` (already deleted), CSS tokens, and adds new CSS classes. Computation logic (NISA, events) unchanged.

---

## ~~33. Spend Panel — Always Visible, Week Grid Compact~~ ✅ Complete

The spend panel was hidden by default (collapsed behind a toggle button) and, once opened, had internal scrolling because all 9 category rows didn't fit.

**Changes:**
- `_spendOpen` initialised to `true` so the panel is open on every load — no toggle needed
- `.week-grid` changed from `flex:1` (fills all space) to `flex:0 0 220px` (fixed compact height), giving spend the remaining room
- `.wk-spend-panel` max-height and overflow-y removed — all 9 rows are visible at once, no internal scroll

---

## ~~34. Finance View Redesign — Hero Strip, Accordions, Sticky Compare~~ ✅ Complete

Replaced the flat single-column finance layout with a more information-dense design.

**Hero strip (3-column grid):**
- Left: large balance + MoM delta (green if up, red if down)
- Center: 6-month sparkline (income line in green, balance fill in soft green/red)
- Right: income proportion bar — colored segments showing what share of income goes to each category

**Two-column body:**
- Left (1.4fr): accordion stack — Income, Fixed Monthly, Food, Transport, Necessities, Optional
- Right (1fr): sticky 3-month compare panel (current + 2 prior months), balance row, YTD avg and annual pace

**Accordion details:**
- Chevron rotates on open; Income opens by default, others collapsed
- Header: chevron · JP/EN title · meta ("N of M filled" for manual sections, "auto · from daily" pill for auto sections) · section total
- Filled fields get accent border + pink background
- Auto rows render as dashed chips with an "auto" badge — not editable inputs

**New CSS tokens:** `--good`, `--good-soft`, `--bad`, `--bad-soft`, `--c-income`, `--c-fixed`, `--c-food`, `--c-transport`, `--c-necessities`, `--c-optional`

---

## ~~35. Bug Fix — Daily Spend Always Shown in ¥~~ ✅ Complete

`fmtSpend()` was converting yen spend values to IDR when `DATA.baseCurrency === 'IDR'`, so the week/month/year spend display showed "Rp" amounts even though all daily expenses are entered in JPY.

**Fix:** split into two functions:
- `fmtSpend(jpyVal)` — always returns `¥` format; used everywhere daily spend is displayed
- `fmtBase(jpyVal)` — respects base currency toggle; used only in Savings view (currency card equivalents, bank account totals, currency total held)

---

## ~~36. Finance — Formula Input in All Fields~~ ✅ Complete

All manual finance fields (income, fixed monthly) and the weekly spend panel now accept arithmetic expressions. Typing `50000*2` or `1200+800` evaluates on blur and saves the result. Implemented by routing all inputs through the existing `parseExpr()` helper. Spend inputs changed from `type="number"` to `type="text"` (with `inputmode="decimal"`) so browsers don't block non-numeric characters.

---

## ~~37. Finance — Per-Month Breakdown Panel + Cumulative Net~~ ✅ Complete

Replaced the 3-month comparison panel (right column of finance view) with a per-month breakdown showing Income, Fixed, Food, Transport, Necessities, Optional, and Net for the current month. A "Total since Jan 2025" line at the bottom sums all monthly balances from Jan 2025 to the current month, giving a running lifetime net.

---

## ~~38. Currencies — Dual Independent JPY + IDR Rates~~ ✅ Complete

Replaced the JPY/IDR base currency toggle with dual independent rate fields per currency card. Each card now shows two editable rate inputs: `1 CODE = X ¥` and `1 CODE = Y Rp`. Changing one does not affect the other.

**Data model change:** `currencyRates` entries upgraded from a single number to `{ jpy: number, idr: number }`. Old single-number saves load correctly (JPY rate preserved, IDR derived on first encounter).

All totals (currency "total held", bank accounts) now show both ¥ and Rp simultaneously. The JPY/IDR toggle button is removed entirely.

---

## ~~39. Week View — Spend Panel Always Visible, Toggle Removed~~ ✅ Complete

Removed the "▾ log spending / ▴ hide spending" toggle button from the week view. The spend panel is now permanently visible. The `_spendOpen` flag and `toggleSpend()` function are deleted.

---

## ~~40. Finance — Commute Category + Section Restructure~~ ✅ Complete

Added `commute` (通勤費) as a new spend category distinct from `transport` (電車代金). Work commute (reimbursable) and personal transport are now tracked separately.

**Spend categories:**
- `commute` (通勤費) — daily commute to work; maps to the Commute Finance section
- `transport` (電車代金) — personal/leisure transport; now maps to the Necessities Finance group
- `necessities` (日常生活) en label changed to "Daily" to distinguish from the Finance section header "Necessities"
- `project` (ゲーム/P) en label: "Project/Game"; `fun` jp updated to full katakana エンターテインメント

**Finance section order:** Income → Commute → Food → Fixed Monthly → Necessities → Optional

**Commute section** (new, hybrid manual + auto): combines 通勤定期券 commutation pass (manual input) and 通勤費 daily commute spend (auto). Commutation pass removed from Fixed Monthly.

**Fixed Monthly** now contains only bills: rent, gas, water, electricity, phone, internet (6 fields).

**Necessities** now includes 電車代金 (personal transport) alongside paperwork, medical, daily, NHI.

**Income deductions — insurance split (May 2025+):** From May 2025 onwards, the single `insuranceDed` field is replaced by 7 separate deduction fields: health insurance, care insurance, child-rearing support, welfare pension, employment insurance, income tax, resident tax. Pre-May 2025 months continue to use `taxWithheld` + `insuranceDed`. Backward compatible: if new fields are empty, old values are used.

**Balance formula:** Income − Commute − Food − Fixed − Necessities − Optional

**Proportion bar:** Commute segment replaces the old Transport segment.

---

## ~~41. Week View — Event Column Height + Spend Panel Spacing~~ ✅ Complete

Reduced event column height from 400px to 200px so the spend panel fits within the viewport without scrolling. Added `margin-bottom: 10px` to event columns and increased spend row padding (`6px/7px` from `3px/4px`) to give breathing room between the event cards and the spend panel table.

---

## ~~42. Events — Editable (text, date, colour)~~ ✅ Complete

Clicking any event pill in the week or month view opens an edit modal pre-filled with the event's current name, date, and colour. Saving updates in place; changing the date moves the event to the new date. A delete button is also available inside the modal. The × on the pill still deletes directly without opening the modal.

---

## ~~43. Events — Labelled Colour Palette + Consistent Colours Across Views~~ ✅ Complete

Replaced the 8 anonymous colour swatches with 9 named category colours:

| Label | Hex |
|---|---|
| education | `#8FAFA2` |
| family | `#86AFC5` |
| friends | `#7C9CCB` |
| health | `#C79A9A` |
| partner | `#B7A6B5` |
| personal | `#D69AA5` |
| project | `#C49A73` |
| travel | `#D1B36A` |
| work | `#B8C89A` |

Swatches now render as labelled pills (dot + name) instead of plain circles. All three views (week, month, year) now use the same colour treatment: `background: color+'18'` tint with `color` text, matching the existing month view style. The year timeline chips no longer depend on category CSS classes.

---

## ~~49. Font Scale — CSS Custom Properties + Larger Base Size~~ ✅ Complete

Introduce three font-size custom properties on `:root` and apply them throughout `styles.css` and inline styles in `app.js`.

**CSS variables (add to `:root` in `styles.css`):**
```css
--fs-base: 15px;   /* body text, tasks, notes, event labels */
--fs-sm:   13px;   /* secondary labels, inputs, sidebar items */
--fs-xs:   11px;   /* tertiary metadata, tiny tags, timestamps — absolute floor */
```

**Steps:**
1. Add `--fs-base`, `--fs-sm`, `--fs-xs` to `:root` in `styles.css`
2. Replace all hardcoded `font-size` values in `styles.css` with the appropriate variable
3. Replace inline `font-size:NNpx` occurrences in `app.js` with `font-size:var(--fs-xs/sm/base)` using the same mapping
4. Verify no font size below 11px remains anywhere

**Mapping guide:**
- 10px, 11px → `var(--fs-xs)`
- 12px, 13px → `var(--fs-sm)`
- 14px, 15px, 16px → `var(--fs-base)`

**Scope** — small. CSS + grep-replace pass in app.js. No logic changes.

---

## 50. Sidebar — Collapsible Toggle

Add a collapse button to the sidebar. When collapsed, the sidebar hides and the main content expands to fill the space. Preference saved to `localStorage` so it persists across sessions.

**Steps:**
1. Add a toggle button `‹` / `›` at the top of the sidebar panel in `index.html`
2. Add `.sidebar-collapsed` class to `styles.css`: sidebar width → 0, overflow hidden, transition for slide
3. On toggle click: add/remove `.sidebar-collapsed` on `#sidebar`, save state to `localStorage('sidebar-collapsed')`
4. On page load: read `localStorage('sidebar-collapsed')` and apply class immediately (no flash)

**Scope** — small. ~20 lines JS, ~10 lines CSS, minor HTML change.

---

## 51. Settings Panel — Font Size Slider + Sidebar Default

A lightweight settings modal accessible from the topbar. Two controls only:

1. **Font size slider** — range input from 12px to 18px (step 1). Changes `--fs-base` on `:root` live; `--fs-sm` and `--fs-xs` derive from base (base−2, base−4). Saved to `localStorage('fs-base')` and applied on load.
2. **Sidebar default** — toggle: open by default / closed by default. Sets the `localStorage('sidebar-collapsed')` default used on first visit.

**Steps:**
1. Add `settings` button to topbar in `index.html`
2. Add `openSettingsModal()` to `app.js` using existing `openModal()` infrastructure
3. Slider `oninput` handler updates `document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--fs-base', val+'px')` and the derived sm/xs values, saves to localStorage
4. On page load: read `localStorage('fs-base')` and apply before first render (no layout flash)

**Prerequisite:** #49 must be complete (CSS variables must exist for the slider to work).

**Scope** — small. ~30 lines JS, minor HTML change.

---

## 52. Code Cleanup — Remove Dead CSS and Unused JS

Audit all five files for code that is no longer referenced after previous enhancements. Do NOT remove DATA model fields (bankAccounts, baseCurrency, etc.) — mobile and desktop share the same save file format, so all fields must be preserved even if not displayed everywhere.

**Known candidates from prior enhancements:**

`styles.css`:
- Day view CSS (removed in #28): `.day-wrap`, `.day-card`, `.day-body`, `.day-slots-col`, `.day-spend-col`, `.day-spend-title`, `.day-hdr`, `.day-num-big`, `.day-info`, `.day-dow`, `.day-full`, `.today-badge`, `.tg-block`
- Time slot input styles (day view): `.time-slot`, `.ts-label`, `.ts-input`
- Spend summary bar chart (removed in #7): `.spend-summary`, `.ss-title`, `.bar-chart`, `.bar-col`, `.bar-fill`, `.bar-lbl`, `.bar-val`
- Week spend toggle (removed in #39): `.wk-spend-toggle`, `.wk-spend-btn`
- Bank account section styles if any existed (removed in #44)

`app.js`:
- `fmtBase()` — added in #35 for IDR base toggle; toggle removed in #38; check if still called anywhere
- Any remaining day view render functions if not fully cleaned up in #28
- `bankAccounts` default in DATA reset — keep for save compatibility

`index.html` / `mobile.html` / `mobile-app.js`:
- Cross-check any IDs or classes that no longer exist in the JS/CSS

**Steps:**
1. Grep each candidate class/function against all files to confirm zero references
2. Remove confirmed dead code only — no speculative cleanup
3. Run a final grep pass to confirm nothing was missed

**Scope** — small-medium. Pure deletion, no logic changes. Safe as long as each removal is confirmed zero-reference.

---

## ~~53. Clean Defaults — Zero NISA Values + No Bank Account Presets on Start Fresh~~ ✅ Complete

When a user starts fresh, the DATA object should have neutral/zero values with no pre-filled entries.

**Changes to `DATA` initial declaration (line 76) and `startFresh()` (line 1680):**
- `nisa.tsumitateMonthly`: `60000` → `0`
- `nisa.projectionYears`: long array of 11 years → `[]` (empty; user adds as needed)
- `bankAccounts`: `[{BCA...},{MUFG...}]` → `[]` (empty array; #44 removed the UI, now remove the presets)

**Scope** — tiny. Two identical DATA literals in app.js, change 3 values each.

Implemented (codex wrote this):
- Desktop `DATA` defaults and `startFresh()` now use `tsumitateMonthly:0`, `projectionYears:[]`, and `bankAccounts:[]`.
- Desktop migration keeps the `bankAccounts` field for compatibility, but no longer inserts BCA/MUFG presets when the field is missing.
- Mobile defaults now use `tsumitateMonthly:0`; mobile `startFresh()` also resets in-memory `DATA` to the clean default object after clearing localStorage.
- Existing uploaded saves still preserve their saved `nisa`, `projectionYears`, `tsumitateByYear`, and `bankAccounts` values.

---

## ~~54. Currencies — Remove IDR, KRW, EUR from Display Cards~~ ✅ Complete

The currency card grid should only show: **CNY · GBP · USD · MYR** (4 cards = 1 row).

IDR is used internally for bond/lot rate lookups via `getRate('IDR')`, so it cannot be fully removed from the `CURRENCIES` array — add `hidden:true` to its entry instead.

**Changes in `app.js`:**
1. In the `CURRENCIES` array (line 54–57): remove KRW and EUR entries entirely; add `hidden:true` to the IDR entry
2. In the currency cards render (`.filter(...)` before `.map(...)`): change filter from `c.code !== 'JPY'` to `!c.hidden && c.code !== 'JPY'`
3. Remove `allIdr` from the total-held display line (since IDR is no longer a display currency) — or keep it if bonds are still tracked in IDR (leave as-is if bonds exist)

**Result:** 4-card grid in one row. IDR rate still available for bond calculations.

**Scope** — small. Array edit + one filter change.

Implemented (codex wrote this):
- Kept IDR in `CURRENCIES` with `hidden:true` so `getRate('IDR')` and IDR conversion helpers still work.
- Removed KRW and EUR from the display currency source list without deleting any saved `DATA.currencies` values from uploaded files.
- Currency cards and total-held calculations now use the visible currency list: CNY, GBP, USD, and MYR.
- Mobile was left unchanged because it has no currency card grid.

---

## ~~55. NISA — Compact Config + Scrollable Snapshot Table~~ ✅ Complete

Three improvements to the NISA card layout:

**1. Default snapshots reduced to 3**
- In the `DATA` literal (line 76) and `startFresh()` (line 1680): `projectionYears` default → `[currentYear, currentYear+2, currentYear+5]` (3 entries instead of 11)
- Note: this overlaps with #53 which sets it to `[]` — if #53 is done first, this change applies only to the constant DATA declaration (not startFresh which uses `[]`)

**2. Snapshot table scrolls in place**
- Wrap the `<table class="nisa-snaps">` in a `<div>` with `max-height: 180px; overflow-y: auto;`
- Keeps the table compact when entries grow; user can still add more via "+ add snapshot year"

**3. Two-column NISA config layout**
- The `.nisa-meta` block (start year / start month / this year monthly) moves to the **left column**
- The snapshot table + add button moves to the **right column**
- Use a flex row wrapper `nisa-config-row` with two children: `nisa-config-left` (meta fields) and `nisa-config-right` (snapshots)
- Left: ~200px fixed or `flex:0 0 180px`; Right: `flex:1; min-width:0`

**CSS to add (in `styles.css`):**
```css
.nisa-config-row{display:flex;gap:16px;align-items:flex-start;margin-top:12px}
.nisa-config-left{flex:0 0 180px}
.nisa-config-right{flex:1;min-width:0}
.nisa-snaps-scroll{max-height:180px;overflow-y:auto}
```

**Scope** — small. JS template restructure + 4 CSS rules.

Implemented (codex wrote this):
- Initial desktop `DATA.nisa.projectionYears` now seeds three suggested snapshot years: current year, current year + 2, and current year + 5.
- `startFresh()` keeps the #53 clean default of `projectionYears:[]`.
- NISA meta controls now sit in a left config column.
- Year snapshots now sit in a right config column with `.nisa-snaps-scroll`.
- Mobile was left unchanged because it does not render this desktop NISA config/snapshot UI.

---

## Maintenance — Expand Year Abbreviations

Implemented (codex wrote this):
- Replaced user-facing shortened year wording with full `year`, `years`, and `/year` wording.
- Renamed matching internal CSS classes and local JS variables to use `year` so editor search no longer finds the old abbreviation.
- Checked desktop and mobile class usage after the mechanical rename.
- Verified `app.js` and `mobile-app.js` syntax.

---

## 56. Savings — Collapsible Currencies and Compact Government Bonds

Requested (codex wrote this):
- Make the government bonds section collapsible so it takes less vertical space.
- When collapsed, government bonds should still show total monthly income.
- Active government bonds should render in two columns when expanded.
- Use the mobile spend section collapse pattern as a reference for the header/summary behavior.
- Make currencies collapsible too if it can be done cleanly.

Implementation notes:
- Preserve all saved `DATA` fields and bond/currency data.
- Do not remove IDR behavior; government bonds and currency lots still rely on IDR calculations.
- Keep this desktop-only unless mobile has matching savings UI.

Implemented (codex wrote this):
- Added desktop savings collapse state for currencies and government bonds.
- Government bonds are collapsed by default and show active/matured counts plus total monthly income in the header.
- Expanded active bonds render in a two-column grid.
- Currencies are collapsible and show total held in both ¥ and Rp in the header.
- Mobile was left unchanged because it does not render the desktop Savings screen.

---

## Maintenance — Project Category Label + Day Letter Abbreviations

- `project` category label updated: `ゲーム/Project` / `Project/Game` → `プロジェクト` / `Project` (app.js SPEND_CATS, renderFinance, mobile-app.js CAT_LABELS)
- `DAY_LETTER` on mobile expanded from single chars `['M','T','W','T','F','S','S']` to 3-letter abbreviations `['Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat','Sun']`

---

## 57. Bug Fix — Spend Log Breakdown Missing After JSON Reload

After importing a save file, cells in the week view show the correct ¥ total but clicking the breakdown shows no rows. Root cause: `DATA.spend[date][cat]` (the total number) is always saved, but `DATA.spendLog[date][cat]` (the line-item array with labels) may be absent if the file was saved before line items existed, or if spendLog was not present in an older export.

**Fixes:**
1. `startApp()` — add `if(!DATA.spendLog) DATA.spendLog={};` guard so load never leaves spendLog undefined
2. `openSpendLog()` — when `spendLogItems()` returns an empty array but `DATA.spend[dk][cat]` has a non-zero value, automatically create a real spendLog entry `{id, amount, label:''}` and call `autoSave()`. This converts the imported total into a permanent line item immediately on modal open, so adding further entries never erases the existing total. Label starts empty — user can fill it in or leave it blank.

**No data migration needed** — conversion happens lazily on first modal open per date+category.

---

## 58. Period Tracker

Track menstrual cycles across a full year at a glance. Designed for irregular cycles — no fixed assumptions, just logged history, visual year strips, and a prediction range.

**Context:** User currently uses Apple Health but finds it hard to see month-to-month patterns. Goal is to see the whole year — where each period starts and how long it lasts (typically 4–5 days) — in a single view. Pain/symptom tracking is a future addition.

**A period branch exists** (`origin/period`) with a working month-calendar implementation. It should NOT be merged as-is because: (a) it reverted the bug #57 spendLog fix, (b) it only shows one month at a time, (c) no symptom tracking. Use it for reference only (CSS classes, prediction logic, modal pattern).

---

**Data model** — new field `DATA.period`:
```js
DATA.period = {
  enabled: false,
  entries: [
    { id, start, length }
    // start: "YYYY-MM-DD" (first day of period)
    // length: number of days (default 5)
  ],
  symptomLogs: [
    { id, date, time, symptoms: ['cramps', 'bloating', ...] }
    // date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    // time: "HH:MM" (24h, logged at time of entry)
    // symptoms: array of keys from the fixed symptom list
  ],
  defaultLength: 5
}
```
Symptom keys are a fixed list defined in code (user will provide the list — placeholder for now). Examples: `cramps`, `bloating`, `headache`, `fatigue`, `mood_swings`, `back_pain`, `nausea`, `spotting`, `breast_tenderness`.

Migration: `if(!DATA.period) DATA.period={enabled:false,entries:[],symptomLogs:[],defaultLength:5}` in `startApp()`. Also `if(!DATA.period.symptomLogs) DATA.period.symptomLogs=[]`.

---

**Layout** (final design based on mockup):

1. **Status hero** — 3-column card at top: Cycle Status · Next Period · Cycle Stats (last 6)
2. **12-month year grid** — 4×3 grid of month mini-calendars, nav ← year → to change year
   - Each month card: month name + cycle length info, 7-col day grid
   - Day states: period (pink filled), period start (dark pink), predicted (dashed outline), today (outline), symptom-logged (tiny dot)
   - Click any day → log/edit period modal
3. **Bottom row** — two columns:
   - Left: Today's log card — flow level quick-chips + symptom summary + "log / edit symptoms" button
   - Right: Cycle history bar chart (last 6 cycles)
4. **Pattern insight card** — shown below today card once ≥3 cycles have symptom data in pre-period window

**Data model** — `DATA.period`:
```js
{
  enabled: false,
  defaultLength: 5,
  entries: [{ id, start: "YYYY-MM-DD", length: N }],
  symptomLogs: [{ id, date, time, flow, symptoms: [...keys] }]
}
```

**Symptom categories and keys** (SYMPTOM_CATS constant in code):
- **Mood**: mood_swings, irritability, sadness, crying_easily, anxiety, emotional_sensitivity, low_motivation, brain_fog
- **Pain**: stomach_cramps, lower_abdominal_pain, back_pain, headache, migraine, breast_pain, pelvic_heaviness, body_aches, muscle_aches, joint_aches, leg_pain, shoulder_stiffness, neck_stiffness, jaw_pain, chest_tightness, heart_palpitations, skin_sensitivity, body_sore
- **Physical**: fatigue, sleepiness, insomnia, difficulty_waking, bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, frequent_bowel, nausea, food_cravings, food_cravings_specific, appetite_changes, increased_appetite, acne, dry_skin, oily_skin, hair_loss, dizziness, lightheadedness, hot_flashes, cold_hands_feet, swelling, weight_fluctuation, clumsiness, sneezing, chills, feeling_feverish, mild_fever, malaise, acid_reflux, gum_sensitivity

**Flow levels** (FLOW_LEVELS): none, spotting, light, medium, heavy — single-select per day

**Period logging modal**: start date pre-filled from click, duration input, delete if editing.

**Symptom logging modal**: full chip picker organized by category (Mood / Pain / Physical) in a scrollable inner pane + flow single-select at top. One log entry per date (upsert by date). Time field records when last updated.

**Settings**: enable/disable toggle + default duration input — in existing settings modal under "Period Tracker" section.

**Prediction**: based on last 6 cycles' min/max gap from the most recent start date. Shown as dashed circles in the month grid and as an estimated date range in the status hero.

**Pattern insight algorithm**: for each period start, look back 7 days for symptom logs; count frequency of each symptom key; surface keys present in ≥50% of pre-period windows; require ≥3 periods with at least one symptom log in their window.

**Quick-toggle**: flow and symptoms on the today card save immediately to `DATA.period.symptomLogs` (upsert) without opening the modal.

**Scope** — ✅ implemented.

---

## 59. Period Tracker — Travel-Aware Prediction

Surface a warning when travel events from `DATA.events` overlap with or fall near the predicted period window, and optionally adjust the prediction to account for travel-related delays.

**Context:** Travel stress commonly delays periods. The lifeOS events data already has a travel category (color `#D1B36A`). If the user has logged travel near their predicted window, they should be warned. If there's historical data showing their period ran late during travel cycles, that can be factored into the prediction range.

---

**Implementation plan:**

**Step 1 — Extract travel events from DATA.events**

Travel events are identified by color `#D1B36A` (the travel palette entry). Collect all `{date, text}` travel events from `DATA.events` by iterating all date keys and filtering by color:

```js
function getTravelDates() {
  var TRAVEL_COLOR = '#D1B36A';
  var dates = [];
  Object.keys(DATA.events).forEach(function(dk) {
    (DATA.events[dk] || []).forEach(function(e) {
      if (e.color === TRAVEL_COLOR) dates.push(dk);
    });
  });
  return new Set(dates); // set of "YYYY-MM-DD" strings
}
```

**Step 2 — Detect travel overlap with predicted window**

After computing `periodWindow()`, check if any travel date falls within a ±7-day buffer around the window (to catch travel that begins just before or ends just after):

```js
function getTravelNearWindow() {
  var win = periodWindow();
  if (!win) return null;
  var buffer = 7;
  var from = new Date(win.earliest); from.setDate(from.getDate() - buffer);
  var to   = new Date(win.latest);   to.setDate(to.getDate() + buffer);
  var travelDates = getTravelDates();
  var hits = [];
  var cur = new Date(from);
  while (cur <= to) {
    if (travelDates.has(fd(cur))) hits.push(fd(cur));
    cur.setDate(cur.getDate() + 1);
  }
  return hits.length ? hits : null;
}
```

**Step 3 — Historical travel delay calculation**

For each past period entry, check if there were travel events in the 14 days before the period started (late-luteal phase). Compare those cycle lengths against cycles with no nearby travel:

- travel cycles: cycle lengths where travel appeared in the 14 days before period start
- normal cycles: all other cycle lengths
- delay = avg(travel cycles) − avg(normal cycles)
- If delay > 0 and at least 2 travel cycles exist, surface it

**Step 4 — Pattern threshold**

Only activate travel-adjusted prediction when there are **≥3 past travel cycles** where the period arrived later than the non-travel average. Fewer than 3 = not enough to call it a pattern; show nothing.

**Step 5 — Shift the prediction range in the year grid**

When the pattern is confirmed and travel is detected near the upcoming window:
- Compute the adjusted range: `earliest + avgDelay` → `latest + avgDelay`
- Render the adjusted predicted days in the month grid using **travel yellow** (`#D1B36A`) dashed circles instead of the usual pink dashed circles
- The original (unadjusted) predicted range is not shown separately — the shifted range replaces it in the grid

**Step 6 — Callout note**

Add a small callout below the status hero (travel yellow border/background), only when the shifted prediction is active:

```
✈ travel detected near your window — based on past patterns, your period
  may be ~X days later than usual.  est. Jun 15–21
```

The callout identifies which travel events triggered it (event text + dates) and states the average delay in days.

---

**What NOT to do:**
- Do not show any travel adjustment if the pattern hasn't been confirmed (< 3 travel cycles with delay)
- Do not show both original and adjusted ranges — only the adjusted one when the pattern is confirmed

**Scope** — small-to-medium. No new data model changes needed; reads existing `DATA.events`.

---

## 60. Apple Health Period Import Script

A standalone Python script (`apple_health_period_to_lifeos.py`) that converts an Apple Health export into lifeOS period entries.

**How to get the export:**
1. iPhone → Health app → profile picture → Export All Health Data
2. AirDrop the `.zip` to Mac, unzip → `export.xml` is inside

**What the script does:**
1. Parses `export.xml` for `HKCategoryTypeIdentifierMenstrualFlow` records
2. Groups consecutive days with flow > 0 into period entries `{start, length}`
3. Maps Apple flow values to lifeOS flow levels:
   - `HKCategoryValueMenstrualFlowUnspecified` → `light`
   - `HKCategoryValueMenstrualFlowLight` → `light`
   - `HKCategoryValueMenstrualFlowMedium` → `medium`
   - `HKCategoryValueMenstrualFlowHeavy` → `heavy`
4. Outputs a `lifeOS-period-import.json` file containing just the `period` block — ready to merge into an existing lifeOS save file

**Usage:**
```
python3 apple_health_period_to_lifeos.py export.xml
# outputs: lifeOS-period-import.json
```

**Merging into lifeOS:**
Load your existing save in lifeOS, then the script output can either be:
- Merged manually (open both JSONs, copy `period.entries` across), or
- A future merge tool handles it automatically

**Notes:**
- Script is local-only, gitignored like `merge.html`
- Does not overwrite existing lifeOS period entries — outputs a separate file for manual review
- Symptom logs from Apple Health (if any) are not imported — Apple stores these differently and they don't map cleanly to lifeOS symptom keys

**Scope** — small. Standalone script, no changes to app.js.
